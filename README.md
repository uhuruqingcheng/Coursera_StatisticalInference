## About the project

In this project, I have use simulation to explore inference and done some simple inferential data analysis. The project consists of two parts:

1. Simulation exercises.
Simulate the exponential distribution in R with rexp(n, lambda).

2. Basic inferential data analysis.
Analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. After provide a basic summary of the data, use confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose.
